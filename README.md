#  Fun with 1200 WS2812b

## Features

* IR control
* AtmoOrb mode
* 4 simple effects
* OTA update

## DualESP

This version needs 2 ESPs, one controlling the LEDs (which is quite
work-intensive, and thus makes listening to WiFi and IR tricky), and
one controlling the other one (with nothing other to do than to handle
WiFi and IR).
